This plugin integrates Affiliates with Ecwid.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates/) with [Ecwid](http://www.ecwid.com/).

With this integration plugin, affiliates are credited with referrals automatically after a customer has made a purchase through the online store powered by Ecwid.

The plugin allows you to set a referral (commission) rate so that your affiliates get credited with a referral based on a percentage of each sale's total net amount.

Required:

- An [Ecwid](http://www.ecwid.com/) account with _Order API_ and _Instant Order Notifications API_ access enabled - this will __not__ work with free accounts.
- [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates)
- [Affiliates Ecwid Integration Light](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates-ecwid-light) (this plugin)

Optional:

- The [Ecwid Shopping Cart](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ecwid-shopping-cart/) plugin for WordPress

Install these, set up your shop, decide how much you want to pay your affiliates and start selling!
